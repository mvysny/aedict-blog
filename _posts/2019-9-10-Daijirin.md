Aedict allows you to download the Daijirin 大辞林 J-J (Japanese-Japanese) dictionary to
your phone. Please follow these steps:

1. You need to create an account on [Aedict Online](https://aedict-online.eu/) if you don't have one yet.
   The account is free to create.
2. Go into Android Aedict `Settings / User Data / Aedict Online Settings` and enter your Aedict Online username
   and password to the first two items. You can use the *"Test Aedict Online username/password"*
   item to verify that you have entered everything correctly. You do not need to enable
   the *"Synchronize With Aedict Online"* setting in order to get Daijirin.
3. Purchase Daijirin.
4. Please mail me a proof of purchase (a receipt, a photo of Daijirin CD) to martin@vysny.me;
   also don't forget to include your Aedict Online account user name.
5. I will activate the Daijirin for you, and I will send you a confirmation mail.
6. After you receive the confirmation mail, go into your Android Aedict's
   `Settings / Dictionaries / Dictionary Manager`. Daijirin should now be present
   in the list. Touch the "Daijirin" list item to download it to your phone.
7. Activate Daijirin in `Settings / Dictionaries / Custom Dictionary` - make
   sure that also the `Daijirin` option is checked.

That's it - now all of your searches should be performed also in Daijirin.

A: No, you can have multiple dictionaries enabled and the search will be performed
in all of the dictionaries that are enabled.

Q: Where to buy Daijirin?

A: Unfortunately I do not know that; however I will accept any proof of any purchase:
